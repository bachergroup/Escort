[`Escort`](https://www.rhondabacher.com/escort.html) is a framework for evaluating a single-cell RNA-seq datasetâ€™s suitability for trajectory inference and for quantifying trajectory properties influenced by analysis decisions. Escort is an R package designed to guide users through the trajectory inference process by offering goodness-of-fit evaluations for embeddings that represent a range of analysis decisions such as feature selection, dimension reduction, and trajectory inference method-specific hyperparameters.

For any other installation issues/questions please leave a message on our [Github Issues](https://github.com/xiaorudong/Escort/issues).

## Running Escort

After successful installation, `Escort` and related packages need be loaded into the working space:

``` r
library(Escort)
```

To use Escort as a Shiny App locally:

```r
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)

Escort::shinyEscort()
```

Many more details and examples on how to use the Shiny App or functions directly in R are located in the vignettes available below and at the [website](https://www.rhondabacher.com/escort.html):
