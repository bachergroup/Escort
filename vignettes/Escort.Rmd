# Introduction

`Escort` is an R package designed to assist users in detecting trajectories, evaluating and ranking various analysis choices. It follows a three-step approach, guiding users through the analysis process by offering goodness-of-fit evaluations for embeddings that represent a range of analysis choices. This encompasses features like feature selection, dimension reduction, and trajectory inference methods, along with their respective hyperparameters.
